# Contributing to the Web3API standard

If you've reached this page it's because you're interested in contributing to the Web3API standard.

To get you started, you can see the [Web3API public roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap), find an issue which you can tackle, and [follow these instructions](./spending-proposals/readme.md). 

You're also welcome to:
- 
  1. Introduce yourself in the [Public Telegram Dev Chat](#linkneeded) and the Keybase Public Community
  1. Ask questions. While we try to document this process, there might be other things that need clarification.
  1. Suggest improvements and project strategies we could consider. Make sure you reach out to the right Point of Contact who finds that suggestion relevant and can help you implementing

# Cotributing FAQs 

## Where are the unassigned issues? 
  They're all in the Web3API public roadmap issue board, filter by unassigned. Or just go [here](https://github.com/web3-api/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee)

## Can I tackle more than one issue at the same time?
  We recommend Starting small: Finding the area where you'd be able to provide the most value with the lowest risk should be the easiest way of getting started.

## Who approves the work proposals?
  The DAO ultimately votes on work proposals to be approved or rejected.

## How to select something from the roadmap:
  1. Make sure that it is not assigned to a squad, or if another builder is planning to tackle it. If it's assigined you can reach the Point of Contact to jump in, or select another item from the roadmap.
  1. If you think that we're missing something important that should be includeded in the roadmap, please reach out to the DAO through any of its public channels
  
### Can I still help with one issue that has been assigned?
  If the specific issue is already assigned, you can still:
  1. Find details of how that squad is tackling that milestone on the specific roadmap issue, by going to their approved [work proposals](./spending-proposals)
  1. Reach out to **Point of Contact** listed on the spending proposal, and they should guide you in finding the right tasks to collaborate on.

### Can I get listed as a Point of contact?
1. Create a new squad or join an existing one
    - If you'll be the **Point of Contact** for that milestone, make sure to create your builder profile
    - If you're creating a new squad, make sure to also [create a squad using this template](../builder-squads/squads/readme.md)
