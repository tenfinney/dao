# Concorde Services for December

| Funds Requested | Time Period | Estimated Effort |
|-|-|-|
| $2,500 + 25.8 `W3API` | Dec 1 - Dec 31, 2020 | 40 hours |

*Note that timeline is an estimate for the deliverables listed below.*


## Summary

I'm proposing a first draft of a product roadmap for the Web3hub, which would serve as the guiding framework for future proposals around interface design and implementation.

It seems that the community aspires to have the Web3hub become analogous to The Graph’s front-end, in that it will
- serve as the main place for app developers to search, browse, and consume available APIs
- serve as the main place for integration creators to create and manage new APIs

This would essentially make the application a two-sided marketplace between application developers and integration creators. There are an absolute ton of directions you can go and features you can build under that umbrella, and so having a strong product/design foundation will pay dividends down the road when it comes to implementing the interface.


## Deliverables

Work has been completed in December towards the following deliverables, although none are complete quite yet. Total project progress is currently ~80%.

1. A product roadmap document for two separate release versions: 0.5 (MVP) and 1.0. Neither versions will include paid features, but will be specifically designed in a way to make supporting those as straightforward as possible.
1a. Some time will be spent reviewing technical aspects of the Web3API project and speaking with community members about future project goals
1b. The document will include details on overall app UX architecture, feature specifications, and wireframe mockups
1c. The document will include a brief section on how the app should generally implement future paid features under the defined app UX architecture
