## Summary

After several group conversations and considering the feedback received from various stakeholders, we are proposing to go with `PolyWrap` as the new brand. For further justification on this new direction [see this issue](https://github.com/Web3-API/dao/issues/138).

This proposal is to execute on the full rebrand effort. The first phase will consist of a high-intensity 6 wk sprint to complete all **Research & Strategy** and ship a first iteration of the **Brand Assets**. This will be followed by a lower intensity 2 wk period to iterate & polish the assets and guide the website redesign team.
