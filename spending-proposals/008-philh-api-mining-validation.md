# Validation of API Mining Scenario

| Funds Requested | Time Period | Estimated Effort |
|-|-|-|
| $600 + 3,78 `W3API` | Jan 15 - Feb 5, 2021 | 12 hours |

NB: An additional budget of up to 50% of the above will be needed in order to compensate support provided by other contributors.

## Summary

I'm proposing to initiate the workstream on W3API token value-accruing mechanisms, with the validation of the API Mining scenario.
Here is the [introduction to this scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lwSaTdAueCQ3Gxcc8zqE5kwYcIomRNKoaFSehQ0IMI/edit#heading=h.s6ro0mhfnczv).

The validation will be based on a series of guided interviews with executives, product managers or business strategists at Web3 projects/companies whose growth depends on their ecosystem of developers. Some of these projects might be Web3API launch partners, but it is not a requirement.

The goal of the interviews is be to establish:
- the reality of the problem that may be solved with API Mining
- the relevance of the principle of API Mining as a way to solve this problem
- the likeliness that if properly implemented, the partner would actually use the solution
- the factors that could make the solution irrelevant, impracticable, or non-competitive compared to other approaches

Interviews will be short (20 to 30 minutes). I'm proposing to conduct 5 to 10 of them.

### Activites 
- Creating support slides for the interviews 
- Identifying the persons to speak to and scheduling interviews
- Conducting recorded interviews
- Filling a detailed report for each interview
- Analyzing the result and providing conclusions/recommendations

## Deliverables
- Interview recordings
- Detailed interview reports
- Conclusions (brief)

## Fund Distribution

All W3API tokens should be send to PhilH's address - philh.p2p.eth
