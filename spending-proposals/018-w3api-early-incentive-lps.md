## Summary
**Snapshot ID**: [#QmPdKvz](https://snapshot.org/#/web3-api/proposal/QmPdKvzY4sgcaF6QXL6fBTbbnw8h6CUeMnyGQJVUd8SNDG)

This proposal is to reward our launch partners for contributing feedback to our documentation. See the docs here: [Web3API Docs](https://docs.web3api.dev/).

This aims to accomplish **2 main goals**: 
1) to get our LPs to actively participate in improving our project 
2) to tailor our support to LPs as they build their Web3APIs.

Feedback will be completed on this [Typeform](https://web3api.typeform.com/to/hSOwDzHy) survey.

(Note: this link may be deprecated when the Typeform updates. If it does, then request a new link from @keeevin#7783 on Discord).

Kevin will be communicating this incentive and details to our current Launch Partners.

## Proposal
The proposal will earmark a reward pool as incentive for LPs to complete and provide feedback for up to 3 guides:

- [Create a Web3API](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-as-web3api)
- [Integrate Web3API into a dApp](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-js-dapp)
- [Create a Plugin](https://docs.web3api.dev/developers/create-js-plugin)

## Reward Pool
**60 W3API tokens total**
- 2 W3API tokens per guide and feedback form completed (Max 6 per LP, limited to 10 LPs)

## Rewards
