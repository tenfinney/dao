# SeaNinjas Fundraise preparation


| Funds Requested | Time Period |
|-|-|
| $0 + 100 `W3API` | Apr 28, 2021 - May 31, 2021 | 

## **Summary**

I am proposing to drive prepation for the next Web3API fundraise. The pre-seed raise in December was highly successful. The Web3API DAO used funds to bring on world class engineers, formalize top tier launch partnerships, and build more robust operations to prepare for the road ahead. To continue accelerating today’s momentum, I propose adapting the Web3API narrative, preparing fundraise materials, and strategizing on the fundraise plan / goals. Through proactivity, I believe we can position the project for a transformative fundraise. I will leverage both my personal experience advising software & crypto projects and my network across the finance, consulting, and startup ecosystems to position Web3API for success.

## **Detailed Deliverables**

- Rebranded Website: Develop story to optimize portrayal of value proposition through a rebranded website. I will work with Web3API team members to execute on this proposal. The rebranded website will enhance Web3API’s ability to attract major customers, industry-leading talent, and world-class backers. As part of this proposal, I will also recommend a new name to enhance the product’s branding and ecosystem positioning.
- Pitch Deck: The Web3API pre-seed pitch deck drove a successful fundraise in late 2020. Since then, there have been many product developments, customer wins, and strategy iterations. I plan to capture all these exciting developments in a concise story, in addition to exhibiting the market opportunity available for Web3API. I will draw on experiences with successful pitches across venture backed companies and successful protocols to materially increase the valuation during this fundraise.
- Advise on Valuation: I will draw on financial valuation expertise to propose a fair valuation based on comparable tokens and business models from successful venture backed companies and projects.
- Legal Entity formed: I will work with lawyers to form an optimal legal entity for the Web3API DAO and its future ambitions.


## **Fund Distribution**


100 `W3API` to be allocated for preparation of the seed deck, stewarding the rebrand, gathering backers, and advising on valuation by May 30th.
