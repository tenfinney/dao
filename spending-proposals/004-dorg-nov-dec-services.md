### November

### Tech - 1 FTEs (154 hrs)
1. [Web3API JS Client Browser Support](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/28)  
    * [Ongoing - ~90% Complete](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/commits/issue-28?since=2020-11-01&until=2020-12-01)
      * MsgPack Nullable Value Support
      * Schema Binding Support Custom Types
      * CLI Codegen Integration Started
      * Implement _w3_call flow
      * Client rewrite almost done, including new marshaling standard
2. [Web3API Manifest's Schema Tooling (Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/pull/50)  
    * [Reviews completed -> PR merged](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/pull/50).
3. [JavaScript Web3API (Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/59)  
    * The concent of "Web3API Client Plugins" has been defined and implemented. These plugins are written in the client's host language (ex: Javascript), and can be exposed by redirecting Uri requests to the plugin's instance.
4. [Make WASM Interface Assemblyscript Agnostic (Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/2)  
    * The schema parsing, composing, and binding pipeline has been built in such a way that Assemblyscript is just one of many supported WASM languages. In order to add support for a new WASM language, simply create new string templates for the generated code in the schema binding package.
5. [Sanitize GraphQL => WASM Function Signature Mappings (Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/16)  
    * The generated code has been implemented in such a way that, if a function signature does not match, the Web3API will not compile. This takes care of GraphQL => WASM function signature sanitization for us.
6. [Cross Module Dependencies (~90% Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/41)  
    * Schema Composer package supports the importing of external and local schema files.
    * Schema Binding package generates code to make calling into these external Web3APIs as easy as one function call.
    * Web3API's WASM interface has been updated to support querying external modules.
7. [Schema Imports (Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/55)  
    * Schema Composer package supports the importing of external and local schema files.
8. [Two Way Data Type Marshalling Between Client & WASM (~90% Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/27)  
    * Schema Parser Breakout
    * TypeInfo, W/ Visitor + Transforms
    * __w3_query & _w3_call standards set and partially implemented
9. [Web3API Schema Sanitization (~20% Complete)](https://github.com/Web3-API/prototype/issues/61)  
    * Initial sanitization happening through schema-parser & schema-composer.
    * A project for defining new sanitization rules still needs to be created.
