# Concorde's Services for March

| Builder | Funds Requested | Time Period | Estimated Effort |
|-|-|-|-|
| Jeff @ Option 1 = | $9,600 + 8.4 `W3API` | Feb 22 - March 15, 2021 | 120 hours |
| Jeff @ final rate = | $10,400 + 7.28 `W3API` | March 15 - March 31, 2021 | 104 hours |
| Andrew = | 21 `W3API` | January 1 - January 31, 2021; March 1 - March 31, 2021 | 40 hours |
| *Total = | $20,000 + 36.68 `W3API` | January 1 - March 31, 2021 | 264 hours |*

*Please note: the numbers above include a couple fixes to billing errors from Janruary, February, and March, detailed below:*
*Jeff's option 1 hours include 40 hours of past work done in February that were missed when submitting final the February proposal.*
*Jeff's remaining March hours are at a $100/hr USD + 0.07 token rate that was aimed to take affect after 1 month of successful project work. Jeff is asking for this rate because he's single handedly implementing the Web3Hub interface which was expected to take ~1.5 developers. He also brings with him ~10 years of development experience.*
*Andrew's hours include 10 hours spent in January that haven't been billed to the DAO yet.*


## Summary

This is a proposal for Web3Hub development, in which we will design and build out the interface according to the Product Roadmap document seen [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8ZJaJZRfDYqjUFRXcB4egwrZQHIUqod9JhIws1g77Q/edit?usp=sharing). Starting in April we'll move to a 3-month proposal with monthly deliverable submissions.

The team composition will be the following for February:
- FT Engineer (Jeff)
- PT PM (Andrew)

Project management will be facilitated through Linear, day-to-day conversations will happen on the Web3API discord, and Andrew will lead the weekly sync meetings to give updates on overall project progress.


## Deliverables

The high-level goals for March are:
- v0.5 UI design 100% completed and Figma files delivered
- 95% polished interface according to the UI design, including animations
- Basic Create API integration that enables core devs to create and publish new APIs
- Spec completed for centralized backend services that enable user sign and publishing to the Web3Hub API index
