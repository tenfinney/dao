The Web3API DAO is responsible for stewarding the Web3API ecosystem. `W3API` governance token holders will have immediate control of the:
- Web3API [roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap)
- [Treasury](https://client.aragon.org/#/w3api/0x8fe59d8fb5ffd3509e5cb3d386be8bdb2d363662/)
- [`W3API` token issuance](#w3api-token)
- [DAO configuration](#dao-configuration)
- ENS domain (web3api.eth)

In the future, it is anticipated that the DAO will also govern:

- Web3API [repositories](https://github.com/Web3-API)
- Web3Hub platform deployments
- DAO-verified APIs (hosted at web3api.eth subdomains)

## How is the Web3API DAO using its funds?

With the goal of delivering the items listed on the [Web3API public roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap), in the first 16 months (Sept 2020 to Dec 2021), it is anticipated that the DAO will allocate funds for:
